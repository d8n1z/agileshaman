# 🪬 Agile Shaman

> **🤖 100% AI-Generated Disclaimer:** This entire repository was created through pure AI collaboration. No human developers were harmed (or employed) in the making of this game. The code, design, gameplay mechanics, and even this README were crafted by AI. What happens when you give an AI too much coffee and a passion for satirizing software development! ☕✨

*Master the Ancient Arts of Software Delivery*

A satirical card-based game where you play as the "Agile Shaman," balancing the mystical energies of software development while navigating the chaos of modern tech teams.

## 🎮 Game Overview

In Agile Shaman, you must guide your development team through 8 mystical sprints, making crucial decisions that affect four core energies:

- **⚡ Flow of Code Spirits** (Velocity) - Your team's delivery speed
- **🧘 Harmony of Dev Tribe** (Morale) - Developer happiness and energy  
- **🌟 Business Blessings** (Customer Happiness) - Stakeholder satisfaction
- **💀 Legacy Demons** (Tech Debt) - Accumulated shortcuts and risks

### Win Condition
Survive all 8 sprints and release the **Legendary Unicorn Product** 🦄

### Lose Conditions
- Velocity reaches 0 → Project fossilizes in eternal planning
- Morale reaches 0 → Dev tribe scatters to the winds
- Happiness reaches 0 → Business shamans banish you
- Tech Debt reaches 100 → The monolith collapses into chaos

## 🃏 Gameplay

Each sprint, you'll face 3 mystical challenge cards with satirical scenarios like:
- **The Cursed Friday Deploy** - Will you risk weekend peace for velocity?
- **The AI Prophecy** - CEO demands everything becomes "AI-powered"
- **Awakening of the Legacy Beast** - 47 bugs emerge from deprecated code

Make choices that affect your energy levels, with some having random ritual outcomes for extra excitement!
